  abstract = {The Billings Reservoir is an important water body for public supply of the Metropolitan Region of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, and water captation for public supply is located in the Rio Grande environmental compartment. This article evaluates the water quality of the environmental compartment Central Body I of the Billings Reservoir, which receives the reversed waters from the polluted Pinheiros River, at four sampling points with different contributions from the surroundings, seeking to verify the influence of seasonality on water quality and whether there was a difference in water quality between the sampling points. Water sampling was carried out on the surface at four points, in a longitudinal profile, covering two periods (dry and rainy) distributed in six samplings between 2016 and 2019. Analyzed variables included temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, chlorophyll-a and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen). Space-Time Interaction tests revealed that physicochemical variables did not vary due to the interaction between sampling periods and points, but several variables varied significantly during the sampling period. The results of the Trophic State Index show that waters of Central Body I are classified as Hypereutrophic, highlighting the degradation of water quality in this compartment. This research will better inform public managers and assist their efforts to minimize and mitigate the effects of progressive water quality degradation in this reservoir. Keywords: eutrophication, Pinheiros river, urban reservoir. 				,},
